# Increment

Increment is a proof-of-concept LLM request cost estimation tool. It demonstrates rapid MVP development through pragmatic trade-offs and assumptions. Built using real data APIs and robust backend calculation logic, it helps developers and product managers predict the cost of using APIs for text-based AI interactions. The dashboard analyses input/output tokens to calculate potential costs, and provides visualisations and breakdowns of usage patterns. Currently, a demo, it shows key features such as interactive cost analysis charts, usage reports and predictive calculations based on historical data. The project emphasises practical development priorities - implementing core functionality and data handling while maintaining a foundation for future testing and scalability. This approach demonstrates effective MVP development by focusing on key features while establishing a solid architectural foundation.
